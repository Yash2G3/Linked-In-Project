# Linked-In-Project
 I took up this project in association with HiCounselor where I got a chance to interact with a lot of other data analysts 
They created a pseudo client based workflow for this project which help me understand how the client requirements work in the data analytics field, by creating strict and structured business requirements throughout the process.

We were given 2 datasets of play-store apps where one of them contained the information of a set of play-store apps and the other data set showed the information about the reviews of the apps

This project consisted of 2 modules

Module1: Database cleaning using EXCEL and PYTHON libraries like numpy and pandas and SQL
For this module we were instructed to identify and remove the unimportant values in both the datasets
1: Using PYTHON i cleaned the duplicate rows in the initial stage and in the latter stage of the module I identified the key factor to arrange all the apps[ The review total column] and sorted the rows accordingly

2: EXCEL of was also used to clean the datasets for finding relevant information and deleting the necessary clutter like that of apps with no ratings or reviews.


3: I also developed my skills in working and importing complexly scraped databases from the web 
and import them in MYSQL WORKBENCH 
Mr Kola Ademola who is an experienced professional in this field also helped me in this process as I am a beginner 
I meticulously filtered all the relevant data to solve a set of 14 different business problems and answer them with extracted insights from these filtered data-sets.

Module 2: The most crucial stage of sharing my insights through simple yet effective visualizations

POWER BI: One of the most essential skills that I learned in this project was to the strength of utility of a software from Microsoft called POWER BI.It is a best in class software developed to generate reports an visualizations without any code 
I extracted and observed pattern in downloaded apps and their customer demographics![Screenshot_20230123_001311](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98349135/213934092-1ec897df-0c07-4aa4-8cf4-9374941687b3.png)
